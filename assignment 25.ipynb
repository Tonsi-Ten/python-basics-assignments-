    "In Python, both square brackets [] and parentheses () are used to create list comprehensions, but they\n",
    "serve different purposes and have different implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Square Brackets []:\n",
    ". When you use square brackets to create a list comprehension, you are explicitly creating a list. \n",
    "  The result is a new list object. \n",
    ".List comprehensions inside square brackets are commonly used to create and initialize lists based on\n",
    "an existing iterable or other conditions.\n",
    ". Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in range(5)]\n",
    "# Result: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Parentheses ():\n",
    ". When you use parentheses to create a list comprehension, you are creating a generator expression. The\n",
    " result is a generator object.\n",
    ". Generator expressions inside parentheses are similar to list comprehensions, but they create an iterable\n",
    "  generator object instead of a list. This can be more memory-efficient for large datasets because it\n",
    " generates elements on-the-fly.\n",
    ". Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "squared_numbers_generator = (x**2 for x in range(5))\n",
    "# Result: <generator object <genexpr> at 0x...>\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    ". Memory Usage:\n",
    "  . Lists created with square brackets are stored in memory as complete lists.\n",
    "  . Generator expressions created with parentheses produce values one at a time, potentially saving memory \n",
    "  for large datasets.\n",
    ". Lazy Evaluation:\n",
    "  . Lists are fully constructed and stored in memory when the list comprehension is executed.\n",
    "  . Generators use lazy evaluation, generating values on-demand as you iterate over them. This can be more \n",
    "    efficient when only a subset of values is needed.\n",
    ". Type:\n",
    " . List comprehensions produce a list object.\n",
    ". Generator expressions produce a enerator object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example demonstrating the memory difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "# List comprehension\n",
    "list_comp = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
    "print(sys.getsizeof(list_comp))  # Size of the list in bytes\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generator expression\n",
    "gen_expr = (x**2 for x in range(10))\n",
    "print(sys.getsizeof(gen_expr))  # Size of the generator object in bytes\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, square brackets create lists, and parentheses create generator expressions. The choice \n",
    "between them depends on the use case: if you need an immediately constructed list, use square brackets;\n",
    "if you want a more memory-efficient and lazily evaluated iterable, use parentheses."

    "The yield statement in Python is used in the context of generator functions. It serves the purpose of\n",
    "producing a value to be iterated over, but with the unique feature of maintaining the state of the \n",
    "function between successive calls. Here are the main purposes of the yield statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lazy Evaluation:\n",
    "Unlike a regular function that computes all its values and returns them at once, a generator function \n",
    "with yield produces one value at a time. This allows for lazy evaluation, where the next value is \n",
    "generated only when it is requested. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or\n",
    "when generating an infinite sequence of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Memory Efficiency:\n",
    "Generators, using the yield statement, are memory-efficient because they don't store the entire sequence\n",
    "of values in memory. Instead, they generate values on-the-fly and only keep track of the current state of\n",
    "the generator function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Stateful Iteration:\n",
    "The yield statement allows a generator function to maintain its internal state across multiple calls.\n",
    "When a generator is called, it executes until it encounters a yield statement, at which point it yields\n",
    "the value and is paused. The next time it's called, it resumes execution from where it was paused.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Infinite Sequences:\n",
    "yield is particularly useful for creating generators that represent infinite sequences or streams of \n",
    "data. Since values are generated on demand, an infinite sequence can be represented without the need\n",
    "to store an infinite amount of data in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Simplifies Code:\n",
    "Generator functions with yield can make code more readable and concise, especially when dealing with \n",
    "sequences of values or complex data processing pipelines. It avoids the need to manually manage the\n",
    "state of iteration and simplifies the structure of the code.\n",
