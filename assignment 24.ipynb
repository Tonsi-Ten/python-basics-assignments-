    "The primary benefits of using lambda expressions in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Conciseness: Lambda expressions allow you to write short, one-line functions without the need for a \n",
    "    full def statement. This can make the code more concise and readable, especially when the function \n",
    "    is simple and used in a specific context.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using def\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using lambda\n",
    "square_lambda = lambda x: x ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Anonymous Functions: Lambda functions are anonymous, meaning they don't require a name. This is useful\n",
    "  when you need a small, throwaway function for a specific task and don't want to define a full function\n",
    "  using def.\n",

    "add_lambda = lambda x, y: x + y\n",

    "3. Functional Programming: Lambda expressions are often used in functional programming constructs such\n",
    "   as map, filter, and sorted. They provide a concise way to define simple functions on the fly.\n",
    "   Example:\n",

    "# Using lambda with filter\n",
    "even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Readability in Higher-Order Functions: When using higher-order functions that accept functions as \n",

    "Output: map produces an iterable of the same length as the input, filter produces an iterable with fewer\n",
    "or equal elements than the input, and reduce produces a single accumulated result.\n",
    "Function: All three functions take a function as their first argument, but the nature of the function\n",
    "differs:\n",
    "map: Applies the function to each element independently.\n",
    "filter: Applies the function as a predicate to filter elements based on a condition.\n",
    "reduce: Applies the function cumulatively to the elements, reducing the sequence to a single result.\n",

    "1.Function Naming:\n",
    "Choose descriptive and meaningful names for functions that convey their purpose.\n",
    "Follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., snake_case for functions in Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Function Length:\n",
    "Keep functions short and focused on a single responsibility (following the Single Responsibility Principle).\n",
    "Aim for functions that are easy to understand at a glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Function Parameters:\n",
    "Limit the number of parameters to avoid complexity.\n",
    "Group related parameters into objects or use default values for optional parameters.\n",
    "Avoid using global variables inside functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Return Values:\n",
    "Clearly define the expected return type of the function.\n",
    "Use meaningful return values or consider using multiple return values (e.g., tuples) for complex functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Error Handling:\n",
    "Clearly document error conditions and how the function handles them.\n",
    "Use exceptions for exceptional cases rather than returning special values.\n",

    "6.Comments and Documentation:\n",
    "Provide clear and concise comments to explain the purpose of the function, its parameters, and any complex\n",
    "algorithms or logic.\n",
    "Use docstrings to document the function's behavior, parameters, and return values.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Consistency:\n",
    "Follow consistent coding conventions and style guidelines within your codebase.\n",
    "Maintain a consistent style for naming, indentation, and formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.Modularity:\n",
    "Design functions to be modular and reusable.\n",
    "Break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable functions.\n",
    "Encapsulate functionality into well-defined modules and classes when appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.Avoid Side Effects:\n",
    "Minimize side effects within functions (modifying global state, I/O operations, etc.).\n",
    "Functions should ideally be \"pure,\" meaning they produce the same output for the same input and don't\n",
    "have observable side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "10.Testing:\n",
    "Write unit tests for your functions to ensure they behave as expected.\n",
    "Consider edge cases and boundary conditions in your tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "11.Parameter Types and Type Hints:\n",
    "Use type hints to indicate the expected types of parameters and return values (if applicable).\n",
    "Clearly document any assumptions about the types of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "12.Avoid Magic Numbers:\n",
    "Avoid using literal constants (magic numbers) directly in your code. Instead, define them as named\n",
    "constants or variables with descriptive names.\n",
    "Performance Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimize for readability first, and then consider performance if necessary.\n",
    "Profile and optimize specific bottlenecks rather than premature optimization.\n",
