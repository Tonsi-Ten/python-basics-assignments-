    "\n",
    "Using logging messages is generally better than using print() for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Logging Levels: Logging allows you to categorize messages into different severity levels (e.g., DEBUG,\n",
    "   INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL). This makes it easier to filter and control which messages are displayed\n",
    "   or saved to log files. With print(), you typically have only one level of output, which can make it\n",
    "   challenging to differentiate between different types of messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Granular Control: You can dynamically control the verbosity of your program by changing the logging\n",
    "   level at runtime without modifying the code. For example, during development and debugging, you can\n",
    "   set the logging level to DEBUG to see detailed information. In production, you can set it to a higher\n",
    "   level (e.g., INFO or WARNING) to reduce noise. With print(), you would need to manually add or remove\n",
    "   print() statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Output Destinations: Logging allows you to direct messages to various destinations, such as console\n",
    "    output, log files, email, and more. This flexibility is useful for debugging, monitoring, and\n",
    "    troubleshooting. With print(), you have limited control over where the output goes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Formatting: Logging provides a rich set of formatting options, allowing you to customize the appearance\n",
    "   of log messages, including timestamps, log levels, and additional contextual information. With print(),\n",
    "   you would need to implement such formatting manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Integration with Libraries: Many third-party libraries and frameworks use the logging module, which\n",
    "    makes it easy to integrate your code with existing systems. When you use print(), it may not integrate\n",
    "    as seamlessly with other libraries that rely on logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Testing and Mocking: Logging can be easily controlled and tested by configuring loggers and handlers\n",
    "    appropriately. This makes it easier to write unit tests and mock logging behavior when needed. Testing\n",
    "    and mocking print() statements can be more challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Security: In production systems, you may want to disable or limit the output of certain log messages\n",
    "    for security reasons. With logging, you can configure the logger to handle sensitive information\n",
    "    differently or filter it out entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Standardization: Logging follows a standardized approach, making it easier for multiple developers to\n",
    "   collaborate and follow consistent practices. print() statements can vary in style and may not adhere\n",
    "   to a standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while print() is a simple way to display messages, logging provides more control, flexibility,\n",
    "and functionality, making it a better choice, especially for larger and more complex software projects. It\n",
    "helps you manage and analyze program output more effectively and efficiently."

    "A breakpoint is a debugging tool and concept used in software development that allows you to pause or\n",
    "suspend the execution of a program at a specific point in the code, usually at a particular line or\n",
    "statement. Breakpoints are an essential part of the debugging process and are used to inspect the\n",
    "program's state, variables, and behavior at a specific moment during execution. Here are the key aspects\n",
    "of breakpoints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pausing Execution: When a breakpoint is set, the program will run until it reaches the specified line or\n",
    "statement containing the breakpoint. At that point, execution will pause, allowing you to examine the\n",
    "program's internal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Interactive Debugging: Once execution is paused at a breakpoint, you can interact with the program,\n",
    "typically through a debugging interface or console. You can inspect variable values, step through the\n",
    "code line by line, and evaluate expressions to understand what's happening in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inspection and Diagnosis: Breakpoints are primarily used for inspecting the program's behavior. They are\n",
    "especially helpful when you suspect that a specific part of your code is causing issues, and you want to\n",
    "analyze variables, conditions, or the call stack at that moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Setting Conditional Breakpoints: In addition to regular breakpoints, you can set conditional breakpoints\n",
    "that only pause execution if a specified condition is met. This allows you to focus debugging efforts on\n",
    "specific scenarios or edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Enabling and Disabling: Most integrated development environments (IDEs) and debugging tools allow you to\n",
    "enable or disable breakpoints. Disabling a breakpoint means that it won't take effect until you re-enable\n",
    "it, which can be useful for selectively debugging different parts of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Removing or Clearing Breakpoints: You can remove or clear breakpoints when you no longer need them. This\n",
    "is helpful for cleaning up your debugging environment and avoiding unwanted interruptions in future runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Types of Breakpoints: Depending on your debugging environment, you may have access to various types of\n",
    "breakpoints, such as line breakpoints (associated with a specific line of code), function breakpoints\n",
    "(associated with the entry point of a function or method), and conditional breakpoints (triggered by\n",
    "specific conditions).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Debugging Workflow: Breakpoints are an integral part of the debugging workflow. Developers typically\n",
    "set breakpoints strategically to isolate and diagnose issues in their code, allowing for efficient\n",
    "troubleshooting and problem-solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, breakpoints are a fundamental tool for software debugging, enabling developers to gain insight\n",
    "into their code's behavior and find and fix issues more effectively."
